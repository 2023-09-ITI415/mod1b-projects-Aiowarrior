The game I have created is a snake game which incorporates movement from roll a ball and the destruction of the collectable 
from apple picker, the collectable also spawns in random location which is also related to applepicker as in apple picker the tree drops 
apples randomly on the map and the framework I have used is MDA as my mechanic is a snake that grows as it eats food and it provides and I
am hoping it provides a thrill aspect to the players and also a goal to see for how long they can survive and how long they can get the snake 
to be.
